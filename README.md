# Replicate_Giannone2021
 We tried to replicate the main estimation function in the Giannone et al. (2021). The replication was successful in modeling the simulated data. However, the results diverged from those in the paper when we used the paper's datasets.
The original code is SpikeSlabGLP.m . A Jupyter Notebook and a Pluto Notebook replication are available along with a static html file. 
A brief summary of the paper is also provided.
